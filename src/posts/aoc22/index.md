December is here and that means that it's time for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_of_Code):
> Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an Advent calendar. It has been running since 2015.
> 
> The programming puzzles cover a variety of skill sets and skill levels and can be solved using any programming language. Participants also compete based on speed on both global and private leaderboards.

Last year was my first Advent of Code and I had no idea how hard the puzzles would be to solve.
My goal going in was to finish all the puzzles each day,
but they eventually got hard enough that I had to put in _hours_ to solve them.
Spending hours each day on a programming puzzle took too much time away from my family,
so I stopped doing them at that point.

I'll be taking a similar approach this year -
keep on going until I feel they take too long to solve.
Though I might actually go back and solve the remaining puzzles during the next year.

I'm not at all interested in the leaderboards - though we have one at factor10 -
so I'll be doing the puzzles in my own time and focusing on practicing my TDD skills in Rust.
