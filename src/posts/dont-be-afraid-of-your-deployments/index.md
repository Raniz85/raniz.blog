I'm going to be speaking at [JFokus](https://www.jfokus.se) in Stockholm on May 3. I'll be talking about Java on AWS
Lambda and how to reduce the cold start times of a _very_ simple function from 11 seconds to less than a second.

My [session](https://www.jfokus.se/talks/822) is in room C4 from 13:00 to 13:50.
