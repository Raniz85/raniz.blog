I've had a relatively busy year with workshops and speaking engagements this far and it continues in the autumn.

I'm currently booked for the following events in autumn 2023:

* [Test-Driven Development for Everyone (Workshop) at PyConCZ in Prague on September 17](https://cz.pycon.org/2023/program/workshops/18/)
* [Three-and-a-half Ways of Testing Your Repositories at DevOpsHeroes 2023 in Parma on October 21](https://www.devops-heroes.net/)
* [Learn TDD By Practice (Workshop) at RustLab (also GoLab) in Florence on November 19](https://rustlab.it/talks/learn-tdd-by-practice)

One conference a month is _lagom_ for me.
More than that and I feel like I'm spending too much time away from the family.

You may notice that there are two different TDD workshops there and that's because
[I updated the title and brief of the TDD workshop](/2023-06-16_chatgpt-presentation-briefs/) between when I submitted to RustLab and PyConCZ.
It's the same workshop and you'll learn exactly the same skills.

Will I see you there?
