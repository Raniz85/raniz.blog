I'm going to be speaking at [JForum #108](https://www.meetup.com/jforum-stockholm/events/288581926/) in Stockholm on
October 4. I'll be talking about different ways of testing the repositories in your infrastructure layer.

The meetup starts at 17:30 and I'm in the second slot at 18:50 following Simon Johansson from Omegapoint who will be
talking about fuzz testing.

Abstract follows:

> ## Three-and-a-half Ways of Testing Your Repositories
> With the data layer successfully separated from the rest of the domain model into its own repository, now comes the
> time to test it.
>
> In this talk I present different techniques for testing repositories that interact with different database backends,
> their advantages and disadvantages as well as when they might or might not be suitable.
