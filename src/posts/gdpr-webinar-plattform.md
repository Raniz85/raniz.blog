So, we're hosting a webinar about GDPR compliance. The premise of the webinar is that you shouldn't just assume that
using american cloud providers is safe, even though you're storing the data in the EU.

So, of course we're going to host that webinar on Google Meet like we've always done, right?

Maybe not, so let's take a moment and write down a few reasonable requirements:

1. GDPR compliant
2. Recording of webinars
3. Multiple speakers
4. No registration for attendees (i.e. we don't want your email address)

# Let's Ask the Internet
I found a list [here](https://www.ventureharbour.com/webinar-software-10-best-webinar-platforms-compared/) of the 10 best
webinar software platforms in 2021. If that link is dead, no worries, I'll go through the list below and see how they 
match up against our requirements.

## 1. Demio
[Demio](https://www.demio.com) is run by Demio Inc. in Tampa, Florida, United States. Demio being run by an American
company immediately disqualifies it for us, so no need to look at their actual product.

## 2. Livestorm
The description of [Livestorm](https://livestorm.co) says that it's based in France and that they're GDPR compliant so
this looks promising. Visiting their site shows a contact address in Woburd, Massachusetts and their footer says that
the copyright belongs to Livestorm Inc. Looking at their [Legal Notice](https://livestorm.co/legal-notice) however says
that the platform is run by Livestorm SAS in France.

It also reveals that they are using AWS, which means that all data go through an American company, which means that
Livestorm is disqualified - even though they promote GDPR compliance themselves.

## 3. Ever Webinar
[Ever Webinar](https://www.everwebinar.com) is run by Genesis Digital LLC out of Las Vegas, Nevada, United States and
also doesn't pass our first requirement.

## 4. WebinarJam
[WebinarJam](https://www.webinarjam.com) is run by the same company as Ever Webinar (Genesis Digital LLC) and as such
isn't GDPR compliant either.

## 5. Webinar Ninja
[Webinar Ninja](https://webinarninja.com) is run by Team ON PTY Ltd. based in Syndey, Australia. Australia is on not
on the [list of recognized countries that provide adequate data protection](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en)
so it's probably not OK to use. Regardless of that, their privacy policy says that their servers are located in the US
so even if Australia would be OK, the US is not so Webinar Ninja is out.

## 6. Webex
Aside from some personal bad experience with WebEx (though that was years ago so might have improved).
[WebEx](https://www.webex.com) is made by Cisco Webex, Cisco Webex is an American company owned by another American
company - Cisco.

## 7. GetResponse
[GetResponse](https://www.getresponse.com) is a Polish email marketing platform that apparently also has webinar support.
Being Polish, they aren't immediately disqualified and reading their privacy policy reveals the following tidbit:

> Recipients who we transfer the data to are based mainly in Poland and other countries of the European Economic Area
> (EEA), e.g., France. Some of them are based outside of the EEA. Weâ€™ve made sure that our service providers guarantee a
> high level of personal data protection. We comply with the applicable data protection laws and GetResponse confirms
> that the conditions set in the GDPR are met. 

"Mostly" isn't good for us and I never bothered to investigate this further because they wanted me to enter them my
physical address and phone number when I tried to sign up.

## 8. ClickMeeting
[ClickMeeting](https://clickmeeting.com) is actually the most interesting platform on this list. They're a polish company
and are very transparent with what services they're using.

Looking [here](https://knowledge.clickmeeting.com/uploads/2020/06/2020.09.Sub-contractros_list_EN.pdf) we can see that
they're using GetResponse for email marketing but also AWS for some hosting. 

I saw a list of supported regions somewhere when I investigated them and it seems that you can select a region served
by OVH Cloud (which is a French cloud provider) which would land them in "not sure" territory, which sadly isn't good
enough.

## 9. Livestream
[Livestream](https://livestream.com) is a webinar platform owned by Vimeo Inc. which is an American company.

## 10. Webinars On Air
Seems to have disappeared so I'm not sure this list really was for 2021. Visiting www.webinarsonair.com makes Firefox
throw up a warning about the SSL certificate not being valid for that host and searching for them only returns other
sites mentioning them.

They were probably American anyways.

# Ok, Let's Look Ourselves
So, that didn't bear any fruit. Can we come up with some alternatives ourselves?

The obvious Google Meet competitors Microsoft Teams and Zoom are out of the race on count of being American companies so
aren't GDPR compliant - regardles of what Zoom [says](https://www.theregister.com/2021/08/17/zoom_incompatible_with_gdpr_hamburg_warning/)

That leaves non-american companies then of which I came up with one: Zoho

## 11. Zoho
[Zoho](https://www.zoho.com) is an Indian company that provides more services that you can dream up. They're probably an
alternative to whatever other app your using and their offering seems decent, albeit navigating them can be a bit messy.

Unfortunately India isn't on the list of recognized countries that provide adequate data protection so we can't be sure
if using services from Indian companies are OK or not. I also could not find any way of disabling email registration for
attendees when I tried it out - you have to enter your email address to get an email containing the link to the actual 
webinar.

# Is This the End?
So, that's 14 platforms (counting Google Meet, MS Teams and Zoom) that doesn't fit our requirements. Is there any other
alternatives?

Sure, hang tight while I author the next post where I will explore open source options - both self-hosted and SaaS
offerings.
